# Logon (Easy)

## Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796

- Hint
    - Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?
